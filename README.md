# flagGuess
Guess whose flag is this?

It is a flag guessing game. It uses flagpedia.net website to obtain countries' flags with their names.

You need to add "Allow-Control-Allow-Origin" extension on your Google browser to be able to run the game.  
Also, you need "shuffleArr" function which you can find in "jsFunctions" repository of mine. 
Please change the value of src attribute of first script tag in "flagGuess.html" with the path where you add the shuffleArr function.
